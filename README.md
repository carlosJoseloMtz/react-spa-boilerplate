# Setup

Just run `npm install`


# npm tasks

1. **build:dev**: Builds the non-minified version of the script to be served.
2. **build:prod**: Builds the **minified** version of the code.
3. **local**: Runs a local server to test the site easier with hot reload integrated.


## TODOs

* Incorporate a testing framework such as *mocha*
* Add the corresponding test cases for each component
* Create a new task to run the tests and make sure everything passes - might need to be ran from the build:prod task as well
